# Minerva

!!! IMPORTANT !!! This library is still in beta, the functionality it has works fine, but it gets expanded and the interface is subject to change.

Minerva, named after the roman goddess of wisdom (and other stuff), is a dependency less (except phobos) D linear algebra library. Main goal is to make the library 100% pure, functional and safe, plus make it one single file.

The main reason Minerva exists is to power Saturn, a complete D only ray tracer without interfacing with any C/C++ library at all.

## Current State

- [x] The 2 and 3-dimensional vectors
- [x] 2x2 and 3x3 matrices
- [ ] n-dimensional vectors
- [ ] n x m matrices
- [ ] operator overloading for basic functions like `add`, `scale`.
