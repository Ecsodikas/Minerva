# Minerva

Minerva, named after the roman goddess of wisdom (and other stuff), is a dependency less (except phobos) D linear algebra library. Main goal is to make the library 100% pure, functional and safe.

The main reason Minerva exists is to power Saturn, a complete D only ray tracer without interfacing with any C/C++ library at all.

## Current State

- The 2 and 3 dimensional vectors are documented, tested and complete. I may add some convenience functions later on, but for now it is done.
- The next step is to add support for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.
